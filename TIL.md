(Finally made one. I've wanted to for a while. So many went past by there's no way I can retrieve them and note them down manually.)

## Shortcuts
- c++ print array
```cpp
for (auto &i: arr) cout << i << ' ';
```

# Python
- `math.hypot()`
```python
# Euclidean distance
# sqrt(x1*x1 + x2*x2 +x3*x3 .... xn*xn)
math.hypot(x1, x2, x3, ..., xn)
```

# Algorithms
## Geometry
### Convex Hull
- Number of vertices(range: N) in Convex Hull is ~O(N^(2/3))
