(Finally made one. I've wanted to for a while. So many went past by there's no way I can retrieve them and note them down manually.)

## Shortcuts
- c++ print array
```cpp
for (auto &i: fail) {
    std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

# Algorithms
## Geometry
### Convex Hull
- Number of vertices(range: N) in Convex Hull is ~O(N^(2/3))
