### 문제 설명

<p>Mari and Jüri are playing a computer game and arguing whose average score is higher. Write a program that based on their results decides whose average score is higher.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 500\,000$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains a capital letter <code>M</code> or <code>J</code> and (separated by a space) an integer $P$ ($0 \le P \le 10\,000$), where <code>M</code> stands for Mari and <code>J</code> for Jüri and $P$ is the number of points achieved during one playthrough by the corresponding player.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output should consist of capital letter <code>M</code> if Mari's average score is higher than Jüri's, capital letter <code>J</code> if Jüri's average score is higher, or capital letter <code>V</code> if Mari's and Jüri's scores are equal. If a player has not played the game at all, then let that player's average score be $0$.</p>
